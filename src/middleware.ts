/**
 * Two jobs, both about what the edge is allowed to tell the outside world.
 *
 * 1. HOST GUARD. Cloudflare Pages always serves the project on <project>.pages.dev and
 *    on <commit>.<project>.pages.dev in addition to the custom domain. Those hostnames
 *    are real, reachable and indexable. A canonical tag is only a hint, so any request
 *    arriving on a non-canonical host gets X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow — the one
 *    signal Google treats as binding. This is what keeps indexing from starting on a
 *    URL we intend to migrate away from.
 *
 * 2. EDGE CACHE. Pages render from KV, so they are cheap but not free. A short shared
 *    cache with a long stale window means an upstream or origin problem shows up as an
 *    older timestamp rather than a failed request.
